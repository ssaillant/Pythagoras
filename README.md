# Pythagoras: A Philosophical Engine

This repository contains the code, dataset, and resources for Pythagoras, which aims to build and share an instruction-following LLaMA model based on text and figures from all Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) entries and linked pages.

## :dart: Overview
Pythagoras's main goal is to create an AI model that can understand and respond to complex philosophical questions and instructions, drawing from the wealth of knowledge available in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and linked pages. The project involves fine-tuning a 7-billion-parameter LLaMA model to achieve these goals.

## :file_folder: Repository Contents
This repository includes the following:

* Data collection and preprocessing scripts for SEP entries and linked pages
* Fine-tuning code for the LLaMA model
* Evaluation and benchmarking scripts
* Sample Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of the Pythagoras model
* Documentation on how to use and contribute to the project

## :wrench: Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pythagoras.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to collect and preprocess data, fine-tune the LLaMA model, and evaluate its performance.

## :books: Data Collection and Preprocessing
The Pythagoras project relies on the text and figures from all Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entries and linked pages. Data collection involves scraping SEP entries, extracting relevant text and figures, and preprocessing the data to create a dataset suitable for fine-tuning the LLaMA model.

Please refer to the data_collection.md file for detailed instructions on how to collect and preprocess the data.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Fine-tuning the LLaMA Model
Once the data has been collected and preprocessed, the next step is to fine-tune the 7-billion-parameter LLaMA model using the prepared dataset. We provide scripts and configuration files for training the model with the Hugging Face Transformers library.

Please refer to the fine_tuning.md file for detailed instructions on how to fine-tune the LLaMA model using the Pythagoras dataset.

## :bar_chart: Evaluation and Benchmarking
After fine-tuning the LLaMA model, it is essential to evaluate its performance on philosophical questions and instructions. We provide evaluation scripts and benchmarking datasets for this purpose, along with instructions on how to perform evaluation and interpret the results.

Please refer to the evaluation.md file for detailed instructions on how to evaluate the Pythagoras model's performance and benchmark it against other models.

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Sample Notebooks
We provide sample Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the Pythagoras model for various tasks, such as answering philosophical questions, summarizing SEP entries, or analyzing philosophical concepts.

Please check the notebooks folder for sample notebooks and follow the instructions in the notebooks.md file to set up and run the notebooks.

## :writing_hand: Contributing
We welcome contributions to the Pythagoras project, including improvements to the data collection and preprocessing pipeline, fine-tuning code, evaluation scripts, and documentation. If you have ideas for new features, additional benchmarking datasets, or bug fixes, please feel free to contribute.

Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute to the project.
